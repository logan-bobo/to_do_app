# To Do App üñäÔ∏è

A web application that allows a user to maintain a "to do" list made using Django and Python.

## Setting goals for this project üéØ
The goal of this project is to use the Feynman Technique to further my understanding of Python, Django, Relational
Databases and software engineering. By creating sections in the readme that will go in to detail about the decisions I
have made and how they enable functionality within this project. You may ask why these technologies and tools? These are
the tools I use in my day job and wish to gain a deeper understanding. Becoming a more proficient software engineer.

## Functionality requirements
The application enables a user to have an individual account, that will store individual tasks. The user can execute CRUD 
operations against these jobs (create, read, update and delete). Notes can also be filtered on the date created, jobs 
complete/incomplete, alphabetical order, ascending and descending and a job tagging system. where users are able to tag 
their jobs with things like "house-work" or "studying". Then filter on these tags.
